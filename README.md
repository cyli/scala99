This is not an open source project so much as it is my attempt to learn Scala by doing the [99 Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99).

I am putting this up because I would like some people who actually know Scala to critique my code, so that I may learn.  :)

Although, to be honest, I haven't thought through how people would leave general pointers - I guess open some issues.

###Rules I am trying to follow:

- Attempting to do TDD using [FlatSpec and SBT](http://www.scalatest.org)

- Will try to follow the [Effective Scala](http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/) style, which means:

    - docstrings using the [ScalaDoc style](https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Writing+Documentation))

    - Basing failure handling on these posts:
        1.  http://tersesystems.com/2012/12/27/error-handling-in-scala
        2.  http://danielwestheide.com/blog/2012/12/26/the-neophytes-guide-to-scala-part-6-error-handling-with-try.html
